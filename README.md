# TC2008B - Modeling of Multi-Agent Systems with Computer Graphics

## Course intention within the general study plan context:
This intermediate computer technologies course focuses on the implementation and generation of computer models, systemic thinking and demonstration of computer system functioning, by studying elements such as intelligent agents and real-time simulation with computer graphics that make it possible to know and apply tools for the real-time visualization of multi-agent simulation results. Prior knowledge is required of object-oriented programming and basic skills in managing video game engine development. Learning outcome: Students develop interconnected software products in real time for the simulation of a multi-agent system and the animated visualization of the result of such simulation.

## Course objective:
Upon completion of this educational unit, students will be able to:
* Generate computer models for solving problems.
* Implement computer models in the numerical solution of a problem.
